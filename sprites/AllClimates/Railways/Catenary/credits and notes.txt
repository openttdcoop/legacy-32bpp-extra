Anyone may do anything with it he or she wants, credits are welcome but not required.
(I expect these graphics to be redone eventually anyway, especially the pylons.)

Note that there seems to be an oversight in the rendering order of these graphics, where
 the catenary graphics cover some pylons, for example sprite 1275. Maybe this should be
 reported as a bug, but I never did officially.
